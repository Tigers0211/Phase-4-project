# README

  This is a collaboration project built by Jordan Jennings, Kenneth Latour, Ben Kurose, and Caleb Summeralls.

  This is a web based application that allows you to create a vision you have for a project with your project partners.  It gives you the ability to have your thoughts 
put to the page in a very visible manner. It allows creatives, artists, and group members alike work on a project board together to get visualize an idea.
  
  Beginning Steps
  
    Upon cloning this application, a bundle install will need to be ran to install the Ruby gems associated with the web application. To install the packages for the 
React frontend you will need to navigate into the example-project directory and then from there, navigate into the client directory.  Once in the client directory,
you will need to run npm install to download and install the dependencies for the webpage.
  
    To run the front end dev server you need to navigate into the example-project directory and run npm start --prefix client and it should open the React Development 
server.  To run the built in backend server you should navigate into the example-project directory and from there a simple rails s command will work to start the backend
server.

  Start Collaborating
  
    Once the development server as well as the backend server are running, you can create your own username and password which will give oyu access to the projects you
are working on.  Once at the main page that shows your projectsyou can then click on your said project or create a new project that will give you the option to add
whatever you'd like to your page.  If you click on the project on your page you will be navigated to that specific projects page.  Once at this page, you have the
ability to add different collaborators via their username and also have the ability to remove the collaborators.  You also have the ability to add more images and also 
have the ability to change the color of all the text on the page using the edit color button.  The webpage also gives you the ability to delete the entire project if
you are not happy with your work.

  Currently, to logout, the logout button needs to be clicked twice however, the bug fixing team is working on clearing it up.
  
  Happy Collaborating
  
    This project was built in four days by the names listed above as a group prject for Phase 4 at Flatiron's coding bootcamp.  The team will be working on fixing some
bugs in the next few weeks.  But, at this time it is a fully function website that will help others begin to share ideas with each other and possibly change the world.

HAPPY COLLABORATING!!
